## Basic Details
### Team Name: Galaxia

### Project Description
Our project "HeightBites" is website which measures your height using fun and unexpected objects like bananas, burgers, teeth, and even bacteria! Instead of boring centimeters, see how tall you are in tasty, tiny, or totally weird units.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This website solves the absolutely crucial problem of not knowing how many bananas tall you are. Because measuring height in boring old units is just too mainstream.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We solve this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù by letting users pick from a bunch of fun objects‚Äîlike bananas, burgers, or bacteria and then converting their real height into these hilarious, unconventional units. With simple input and playful math, we turn your height into a weirdly awesome measurement that‚Äôs way more entertaining than a regular ruler!
